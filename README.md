## LEAD A SPACE FORCE OFFICER THROUGH MARS

Captain Jimmy McSpacerton is lost on Mars.  Help Jimmy search for the elusive and magical Mintbean Star to help him find his way home!

## HOW TO PLAY

- Guide Captain McSpacerson through the dangerous Mars terrain, avoiding obstacles such as spikes, lava, green poison, fireballs, and more...
- Running into or stepping on these VERY harmful objects will hurt Jimmy and deduct 25% from his health. Be careful! If you run out of health, it's GAME OVER.
- However, there’s good news!  A very generous inhabitant decided to leave several health packs throughout the level! These health packs  will not only restore 50% of Jimmy’s health, but also provide a BRAND NEW checkpoint  should Jimmy run into any trouble during his adventures!
- Traverse across and up the dangerous platform terrain and reach the top where you will find the magical Mintbean Star and achieve GLORIOUS VICTORY!
