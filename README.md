## LEAD A SPACE FORCE OFFICER THROUGH MARS

Oh no! Captain Jimmy McSpacerton is lost on Mars.  Help Jimmy search for the elusive and very magical Mintbean Star to help him find his way home!

## HOW TO PLAY

- Guide Captain McSpacerson through the dangerous Mars terrain, avoiding obstacles such as spikes, lava, green poison, fireballs, and more...

- Running into or stepping on these VERY harmful objects will hurt Jimmy and deduct 25% from his health. Be careful! If you run out of health, it's GAME OVER.

- However, there’s good news!  A very generous inhabitant decided to leave several health packs throughout the level! These health packs  will not only restore 50% of Jimmy’s health, but also provide a BRAND NEW checkpoint  should Jimmy run into any trouble during his adventures!

- Traverse across and up the dangerous platform terrain and reach the top where you will find the magical Mintbean Star  and achieve GLORIOUS VICTORY!
